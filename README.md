# ShopSmart

## Project Summary

ShopSmart uses computer vision and AI to help consumers track and compare prices across various stores. By simply uploading or taking a photo of an item with its price tag, ShopSmart detects the product, identifies its category, extracts the price, and stores this information in a database. This enables easy price comparison for shoppers.
